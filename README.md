# 🧩 BASE ECO  
_modular playground for building the Base ecosystem_

> building composable infra and privacy-aware modules for the onchain future.  
> powered by Base ⚡ built by @CryptoD0N

## 🌍 Overview

**BASE ECO** is an experimental framework focused on developing modular tools, SDKs, and micro-apps for the **Base ecosystem**.  
the goal is to explore how onchain logic can be made **faster, cheaper, and more composable** while staying aligned with Base’s “onchain summer” ethos.

this repo acts as a **scaffold** for modules, each targeting a specific vertical in the Base stack — from DeFi utils and onchain data parsing to privacy-preserving middleware.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

**BASE ECO** is structured into modular layers for easy extension:

base-eco/
│
├── core/ # shared utils, config, constants
├── modules/ # standalone features (each in its own folder)
│ ├── vault/ # storage layer or encrypted data sandbox
│ ├── compute/ # computation logic or SDK integrations
│ └── api/ # optional API endpoints (if running fullstack)
├── scripts/ # setup, deploy, automation scripts
└── main.js # entry point or example module runner


Each module can be shipped independently or imported as a package into another dApp.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Base** — the L2 network (built on OP Stack)
- **TypeScript / JavaScript** — core logic and SDK integrations  
- **Ethers.js / viem** — for contract calls  
- **Hardhat / Foundry** — for smart contract dev (optional)  
- **Next.js / Wagmi** — for frontend demo dApps  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CryptoD0N/base-eco.git
npm install
npm run dev

---

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [x] Scaffold Base ECO structure  
- [ ] Integrate Base SDK  
- [ ] Deploy first demo module  
- [ ] Connect with Base Builders & Founders  
- [ ] Ship on Base testnet

## 🤝 Contributing

Fork it, build it, PR it — Base ECO is open for builders.  
Each module adds a new layer to the Base ecosystem.
